    <h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains basic machine learning projects to understand concepts such as linear and logisitic regression. Well-known datasets such as the headbrain dataset and titanic data set have been used for data analysis.</p>

<h2 id="datasets">Datasets</h2>
<p>Details about the datasets used in this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Titanic Dataset</b>: Contains information about the passengers of the Titanic, including attributes such as age, gender, class, and survival status. The objective is to predict the survival of passengers based on these attributes.</li>
  <li><b>Headbrain Dataset</b>: Includes measurements of the head and brain, such as head size and brain weight. The objective is to understand the relationship between head size and brain weight and predict brain weight based on head size.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notebooks">Notebooks</h2>
<p>The repository contains the following notebooks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Logisitic Regression ML 2.ipynb</b>: Detailed analysis and model building on the Titanic dataset.</li>
  <li><b>Linear Regression.ipynb</b>: Detailed analysis and model building on the Headbrain dataset.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To run the notebooks locally, you need to install the following dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can open the notebooks directly in Google Colab, which comes with these dependencies pre-installed.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Clone the repository</b>:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-projects.git</code></pre>

<ol start="2">
  <li><b>Navigate to the project directory</b>:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>cd ml-projects</code></pre>

<ol start="3">
  <li><b>Open the notebooks</b>:</li>
</ol>

<p>You can open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:</p>

<pre><code>jupyter notebook</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can upload the notebooks to Google Colab:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a>.</li>
  <li>Upload the notebook file (.ipynb).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The results section in each notebook provides insights and evaluation metrics for the models trained. Here is a brief summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Titanic Dataset</b>: The models predict the survival of passengers with detailed performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Graphs are plotted to show comparsion between factors such as ticket fare, passenger class and age.</li>
  <li><b>Headbrain Dataset</b>: The regression models show a  correlation between head size and brain weight, with performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared value.</li>
</ul>
