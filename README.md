## Project Overview

In this repository, I have explored various **machine learning** concepts using well-known datasets. 
## Datasets

### Titanic Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains data on the passengers aboard the Titanic, including attributes like age, gender, class, and survival status. The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on these features.

**Key features**:
- `Age`
- `Gender`
- `Class`
- `Fare`
- `Survival Status` (Target)

### Headbrain Dataset

This dataset includes measurements of head size and brain weight. The goal is to predict brain weight based on head size using regression techniques.

**Key features**:
- `Head size`
- `Brain weight` (Target)

## Notebooks

The repository contains the following notebooks:

1. **Logistic Regression ML 2.ipynb**: Applying **Logistic Regression** to predict survival on the Titanic dataset.
2. **Linear Regression.ipynb**: Using **Linear Regression** to predict brain weight from head size.
3. **Titanic_Dataset_Random_Forest_for_classification.ipynb**: Implementing **Random Forest Classifier** for survival prediction.
4. **RegEx.ipynb**: Exploring **Regular Expressions** for pattern matching and text extraction.
5. **TextExtractionOCRipynb.ipynb**: Using **OCR** to extract text from images.
6. **mobile_data_linear_regression.ipynb**: Analyzing mobile data using **Linear Regression** to predict various features.
